        <p>In 2020, I graduated from Wright State University with a Bachelor of Science. I majored in Psychology with a specialization in Behavioral Neuroscience. I planned on attending medical school, but as I got closer to it, began working more closely with doctors and the medical staff, and got a better feel for what my day-to-day life would be like as a doctor, I began to feel like it may not be the right path for me.</p>
        <p>In 2023, I receieved a certificate in Full Stack Flex Web Development. I am still new, but I'm very happy that I made the change. I really enjoy UI/UX work and front end development but, as a full stack developer, I am comfortable with back end development as well.</p>
        <p>Today, I am working at Fedex as a courier while doing freelance coding in my free time. I am heavily involved in creative projects outside of coding; I am playing the piano and working on a creative writing project, but my biggest focus currently are the coding projects left over from the bootcamp and my own personal coding projects, some of which can be found in my portfolio section!</p>
